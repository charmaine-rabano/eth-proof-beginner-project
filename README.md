# Create A Token (ETH Proof Beginner Project)

This Solidity program is a smart contract that imitates the creation of a token. 

This program was created as a project for the [Metacrafters ETH Proof Beginner course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/content/solidity-beginner).

## Description

This contract publicly stores the name, abbreviation and total supply of the token, as well as the token balance of certain addresses via mapping. This has 2 functions: mint() and burn(). The mint function mints tokens by increasing the token's total supply and the balance of the sender by a certain value. The burn function, on the other hand, decreases the total supply and the sender's balance.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an online Solidity IDE.
